# NFL_Momentum_Shift - Masters Thesis EWU
A momentum-shift prediction model using play-by-play data over the course of 10 NFL seasons. Conducted exploratory data analysis to identify high-impact trends influencing momentum. Leveraged win probability models, XGBoost, and ensemble classifiers. Engineered over 40 features including a custom momentum score system, evaluated results using SHAP values and temporal performance windows, and validated findings using short-term success metrics. Demonstrated that momentum shifts could be predicted at a reliable rate, leading to successful outcomes over 60% of the time.


Dataset compiled of all seasons 2009 - 2019 from NFLFastR
